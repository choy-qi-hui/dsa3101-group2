For example, perishable goods (e.g. `Amazon Fresh`, `Grocery`) have very short lead times (2–7 days) due to their quick turnover and necessity for freshness. Digital products (e.g. `Gift Cards`, `Software`, `Prime Video`) have extremely short lead times (1–3 days or instant) as they do not require physical delivery.\n",
